In Java, `wait()` and `sleep()` are methods used to pause the execution of threads, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

 `wait()`

- **Definition**: The `wait()` method is used for thread synchronization. It allows a thread to release the lock it holds and wait until another thread notifies it to wake up.

- **Context**: It is used in conjunction with synchronization mechanisms and typically within a synchronized block or method. The thread calling `wait()` must own the monitor (lock) of the object on which `wait()` is called.

- **Usage**: Commonly used in producer-consumer scenarios or other situations where threads need to wait for certain conditions to be met.

- **Example**:

  ```java
  class SharedResource {
      private boolean available = false;

      public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
          while (!available) {
              wait(); // Wait until available is true
          }
          System.out.println("Consuming resource");
          available = false;
          notify(); // Notify other threads waiting on this object
      }

      public synchronized void produce() {
          available = true;
          System.out.println("Producing resource");
          notify(); // Notify other threads waiting on this object
      }
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

          new Thread(() -> {
              try {
                  resource.consume();
              } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
          }).start();

          new Thread(() -> {
              resource.produce();
          }).start();
      }
  }
  ```

### `sleep()`

- **Definition**: The `sleep()` method is used to pause the execution of the current thread for a specified amount of time. It does not release any locks.

- **Context**: It is a static method of the `Thread` class and can be used without any synchronization context. It is typically used for introducing delays or for timing purposes.

- **Usage**: Commonly used to simulate delays, perform periodic actions, or control the execution timing of threads.

- **Example**:

  ```java
  public class SleepExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
              for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                  System.out.println("Thread running: " + i);
                  try {
                      Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
                  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                      System.out.println("Thread interrupted.");
                  }
              }
          });

          thread.start();
      }
  }
  ```

### Key Differences

1. **Purpose**:
   - `wait()`: Used for inter-thread communication and synchronization. It allows a thread to wait until another thread signals it to continue.
   - `sleep()`: Used to introduce a delay in a thread's execution. It does not involve thread communication or synchronization.

2. **Locking**:
   - `wait()`: Requires the thread to hold the monitor (lock) of the object on which `wait()` is called.
   - `sleep()`: Does not involve any locks or monitors.

3. **Notification**:
   - `wait()`: Can be used with `notify()` or `notifyAll()` to wake up waiting threads.
   - `sleep()`: Does not interact with other threads directly. It simply pauses the thread's execution for a specified period.

Understanding when and how to use these methods can help in designing efficient and synchronized multi-threaded applications.
